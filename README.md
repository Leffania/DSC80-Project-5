# Analysis of NYPD Civilian Complaints

### Introduction
This repository includes Python code in a two-part study:

1. Using statistical means, examine if the values for complainant gender were missing due to officer ethnicity or officer gender, or if their absence was attributed to random chance.
2. Build a machine learning model to predict officer ethnicity and find possible patterns in the data that make officer ethnicity particularly predictable.

### Files
`allegations.csv`: source data for NYPD civilian complaints with features about both complainants and officers along with date, time, and specific allegations of the complaint filed
`notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing an exploratory data analysis, statistical tests, decision tree classifiers, and written commentary on the methods and conclusions of the analyses

### Requirements
The following Python packages are required to run the Jupyter notebook:

- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `sklearn`
